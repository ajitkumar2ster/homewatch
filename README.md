# homewatch
A home security and automation system written in Python

Prerequisites:
### You need a Raspberry Pi 3+
### You need a GPIO breadboard and jumper wires.
### You need to install a few libs which dont come bundled with Raspian
+ sudo pip install telepot
+ sudo pip install configparser
### Setup your home sensor pins as in the .conf file.

You will notice in the code that I am using a proxy. This is because some ISPs tend to block bots. So I have setup my pi as a proxy server as well. I followed a simple process of setting up a tor proxy server.

Give it a whirl!
